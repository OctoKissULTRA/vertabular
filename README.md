# Vertabular

A minimal, open-source vertical tab manager for Chrome. No bloat, no tracking, just tabs on the side.

## Features
- **Native Feel:** Uses the Side Panel API for seamless integration.
- **Focus Mode:** Toggle fullscreen to hide the top tab bar.
- **Workspaces:** Save and switch between tab sets (Cloud Synced).
- **Hibernation:** Free up memory by discarding background tabs.
- **Mobile Bridge:** Sync workspaces to your phone via bookmarks.
- **Keyboard Friendly:** Navigate with arrow keys, search with `/`.

## Installation
1. Download the code.
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`.
3. Enable **Developer Mode**.
4. **Load Unpacked** and select the folder.

## Privacy
Vertabular is 100% client-side. Your data never leaves your browser, except when synced to your own Google account via Chrome Sync.
